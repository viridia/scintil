scintil
=======

Scintil is a texture generator application. It's intent is to make it easy to create tileable textures for
use in 3D models.

Scintil is heavily inspired by Holger Dammertz's NeoTextureEdit application. There are a number of significant
differences between the two programs, the biggest of which is the fact that Scintil has been entirely rewritten in
Scala.
