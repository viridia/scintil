Scintil
=======

Scintil is a texture generator application. It's intent is to make it easy to create tileable textures for use in 3D models.

Scintil is heavily inspired by Holger Dammertz's NeoTextureEdit application. There are a number of significant differences between the two programs, the biggest of which is the fact that Scintil has been entirely rewritten in Scala.

Here's a sample screen shot of Scintil's user interface:

Major TODO items:

 * Load and save graphs
 * Export generated images
 * Many more node types!
 * Undo / Redo
 * Cut / Copy / Paste
 * Node deletion
 * Document scrolling
